## Objectives

- Use asynchronous JavaScript tools to build a responsive web application.
- Demonstrate understanding of the JavaScript event loop.
- Generate asynchronous code using Promises and async/await syntax.
- Use fetch and/or Axios to interact with an external web API.
- Organize files using modules and imports.

## My struggles

 - Founding a good API 
 - I had a really hard time starting JS without having HTML and CSS
 - Had I hard time to get my button away from the movie Img and description
 - Needed to place max-width and use flex box to move everything 
 - It was confusing doing the import and export on multiple pages
 - Another struggle was getting my button on side and the movie info on the other side.
 - Biggest struggle was making sure my JS code worked in 4 pages and that I import and export correctly 

# Movie Date 

This application allows users to load and explore movie data from an external API.
Users can retrieve random movies and view their poster and description for Movie nights.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Axios
- External REST API

## Features

- Fetches movie data from an API
- User interaction through button
- Modular JavaScript structure

## My Checklist

- Use the fetch API or Axios to communicate with an external web API. Use the data provided by this API to populate your application's content and features. (I used axios✔️ )

- Create user interaction with the API through a search feature, paginated gallery, or similar. This feature should use GET requests to retrieve associated data. (I did a interactive button✔️ )

- Make use of Promises and async/await syntax as appropriate. (async and await in api.js and events.js✔️ )

- Organize your JavaScript code into at least three (3) different module files, and import functions and data across files as necessary. (main.js, events.js, api.js and dom.js✔️ )

- Ensure the program runs as expected, without any undesired behavior caused by
misunderstanding of the JavaScript event loop (such as race conditions, API calls being handled out of order, etc.). (No errors ✔️ )

- Create an engaging user experience through the use of HTML and CSS. (Done ✔️ )

- Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit). (Put my stuggles in my README.md and put some comments on some of my pages ✔️ )

- Commit frequently to the git repository. 10 or more ✔️ 

- Include a README file that contains a description of your application. (looks good lol ✔️ )

- Level of effort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience. (It's a simple site for couple's, straight to the point site ✔️ )
