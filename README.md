## Objectives

- Use asynchronous JavaScript tools to build a responsive web application.
- Demonstrate understanding of the JavaScript event loop.
- Generate asynchronous code using Promises and async/await syntax.
- Use fetch and/or Axios to interact with an external web API.
- Organize files using modules and imports.

## My struggles

 - I had a really hard time starting JS without having HTML and CSS

# Movie Date Ap

This application allows users to load and explore movie data from an external API.
Users can retrieve random movies and view their poster and description.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Axios
- External REST API

## Features

- Fetches movie data from an API
- User interaction through button
- Modular JavaScript structure

## My Checklist

- Use the fetch API or Axios to communicate with an external web API. Use the data provided by this API to populate your application's content and features.

- Create user interaction with the API through a search feature, paginated gallery, or similar. This feature should use GET requests to retrieve associated data.

- Make use of Promises and async/await syntax as appropriate.

- Organize your JavaScript code into at least three (3) different module files, and import functions and data across files as necessary.

- Ensure the program runs as expected, without any undesired behavior caused by
misunderstanding of the JavaScript event loop (such as race conditions, API calls being handled out of order, etc.).

- Create an engaging user experience through the use of HTML and CSS.

- Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).

- Commit frequently to the git repository. 10 or more ✔️ 

- Include a README file that contains a description of your application.

- Level of effort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience.
